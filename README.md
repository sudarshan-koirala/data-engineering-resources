# data-engineering-resources
Repo with data engineering resources 

- To be clear, this is not a roadmap for `getting started` with Data Engineering.
- I am not covering the books you should study, university studies, certificates, etc.
- I assume you have satisfactory understanding of `Python` and `SQL`. `Scala` good to have.
- After knowing the basics and how things work, it's upon you, what to do ( Or lets say if it's your cup of tea / coffee or not )
> Remember one thing, `knowing` and `implementing` Data Engineering tools are different thing, try to `implement` if it is a simple program or project.

## Choose between
- [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) and [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/)

## Modern Open Source Data Stack

> Do some research on what sorts of company you want to apply job and what tools they use ( you can achieve this by just going through the job description of those companies)
Example:
- [Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/314022739)
- [Facebook](https://www.metacareers.com/v2/jobs/9852899174780718/)
- [KONE](https://kone.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/Careers/job/Data-Engineer_R0632051)

## Books
- There are many books but if you want me to suggest one, go for `Fundamentals of Data Engineering` by Joe Reis, Matt Housley.

## Youtube ( Free University )
- There is unlimited knoweledge you can grasp, try to find the best ones and follow them instead of jumping among videos.

> Main thing I want to highlight, practice practice and practice, take help with AI assistants ðŸ‘‡
 
# AI Assistants ( Remember, personal use or enterprise use )
- [Perplexity AI](https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=YAWB6JNV) --> let's put this way, it's Google Search with LLMs with it.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) --> Based on your need, free or paid version. ( Team, Enterprise , etc)
- [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx) , Bing Enterprise.
